-------------
- Fix studentQueue screen to only show queue info - No question info
- Fix studentInterview screen to only show interview info -No question info
- For both of those screens, update to follow the new instructor screen 
styling/ structure. The older one had a lot of fixed height columns and was 
too complicated, this new one is simpler and more reactive to window resizing.
